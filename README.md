# Text Tools (TT)

Welcome to **Text Tools (TT)** â€“ a powerful Lua library designed to enhance your text manipulation experience in NeoVim, focusing primarily on a context-aware "Range" utility. This utility allows you to work efficiently with text selections based on various conditions, in a variety of contexts, making coding and editing more intuitive and productive.

This is meant to be used as a **library**, not a plugin. On its own, text-tools.nvim does nothing on its own. It is meant to be used by plugin authors, to make their lives easier based on the variety of utilities I found I needed while growing my NeoVim config.

## Features

- **Range Utility**: Get context-aware selections with ease.
- **Code Writer**: Write code with automatic indentation and formatting.
- **Operator Key Mapping**: Flexible key mapping that works with the selected text.
- **Text and Position Utilities**: Convenient functions to manage text objects and cursor positions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-tools.git
   ```
2. Add the path to your `init.vim` or `init.lua`:
   ```lua
   package.path = package.path .. ';/path/to/text-tools/lua/?.lua'
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Creating a Range

To create a range, use the `Range.new(startPos, endPos, mode)` method:

```lua
local Range = require 'tt.range'
local startPos = Pos.new(0, 1, 0)  -- Line 1, first column
local endPos = Pos.new(0, 3, 0)    -- Line 3, first column
local myRange = Range.new(startPos, endPos)
```

### 2. Working with Code Writer

To write code with indentation, use the `CodeWriter` class:

```lua
local CodeWriter = require 'tt.codewriter'
local cw = CodeWriter.new()
cw:write('{')
cw:indent(function(innerCW)
    innerCW:write('x: 123')
end)
cw:write('}')
```

### 3. Defining Key Mappings

Define custom key mappings for text objects:

```lua
local opkeymap = require 'tt.opkeymap'

-- invoke this function by typing, for example, `<leader>riw`:
-- `range` will contain the bounds of the motion `iw`.
opkeymap('n', '<leader>r', function(range)
    print(range:text())  -- Prints the text within the selected range
end)
```

### 4. Utility Functions

#### Cursor Position

To manage cursor position, use the `Pos` class:

```lua
local Pos = require 'tt.pos'
local cursorPos = Pos.new(0, 1, 5)  -- Line 1, character 5
print(cursorPos:char())  -- Gets the character at the cursor position
```

#### Buffer Management

Access and manipulate buffers easily:

```lua
local Buffer = require 'tt.buffer'
local buf = Buffer.current()
print(buf:line_count())  -- Number of lines in the current buffer
```
